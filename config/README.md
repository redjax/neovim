# Neovim Configurations

My Neovim configurations. The default configuration in [`nvim`](./nvim/) is my main template. I make best efforts for a cross-platform configuration that will work on Linux and Windows.

Over time, I may add other configurations here, i.e. a "work" configuration, or a simpler configuration with no external dependencies.
