# Neovim Lite

"Lite" doesn't exactly mean lightweight here. This profile has a more 'flat' directory structure, with less nesting i.e. `lua/plugins/lazy/packages/` -> `lua/plugins/`.

I use plugins to make Neovim more functional, and occasionally to make it look a little nicer. This profile tries to keep things to what I consider my "bare minimum," the plugins I like and make the most use of. This differs from the [default profile](../nvim/), where I load up plugins for the most 'complete' experience. This profile aims to strike a balance between QOL plugins and easier management.
